LeWagon Page

Welcome to the LeWagon page project! This project showcases a web page that has been styled using Tailwind CSS instead of traditional CSS. The decision to use Tailwind CSS was made to leverage its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid and responsive design.

Project Overview
This project is a demonstration of how Tailwind CSS can be used to style a modern web page with clean and maintainable code. The main features include:

Responsive design with Tailwind CSS.

Functional buttons and cards with added links to enhance user interaction.

Key Features
Tailwind CSS Styling: Instead of using traditional CSS, Tailwind CSS was used to style the entire page. This approach simplifies the process of creating responsive and flexible layouts.

Enhanced Functionality: The project goes an extra mile by adding links to buttons and cards, making them more interactive and functional.

Challenges
One of the main challenges faced during this project was:

Image Sizing: Adjusting the size of the pictures to fit the design perfectly was difficult. Tailwind's utility classes for width and height were useful, but required careful tweaking to get the desired look.
